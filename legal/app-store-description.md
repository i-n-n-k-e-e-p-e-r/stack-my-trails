YOUR DATA, YOUR DEVICE

Stack My Trails stores everything locally on your device. No accounts, no servers, no tracking. Your workout data is yours. The only network request the app makes is to Apple's geocoding service during import to convert route coordinates into place names (e.g., city and region). Once imported, everything works offline.

## App Review Notes

This app reads workout route data from Apple Health to visualize GPS routes on a map. Users must explicitly tap "Import" to load their workouts. The app does not write to HealthKit and does not access data in the background. During import, route center coordinates are sent to Apple's geocoding service to resolve place names. No other data is transmitted to external servers. All data is stored locally on the device.

To test: Import workouts from Apple Health via Settings tab, then view routes on the Stack tab. Tap the export button to create a poster.
