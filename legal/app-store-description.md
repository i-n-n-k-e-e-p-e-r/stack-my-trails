## App Review Notes

This app reads workout route data from Apple Health to visualize GPS routes on a map. Users must explicitly tap "Import" to load their workouts. The app does not write to HealthKit, does not access data in the background, and does not transmit any data to external servers. All data is stored locally on the device.

To test: Import workouts from Apple Health via Settings tab, then view routes on the Stack tab. Tap the export button to create a poster.
